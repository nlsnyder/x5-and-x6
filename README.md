Title: Medieval World Simulator

Description:  In Dungeons and Dragons, it is nigh impossible to emulate the economies of fictional countries before each session, where doing so can add a new layer of depth to the world. Some areas can be impoverished, lords can be more susceptible to bribery if they are low on funds, and much more. A program that emulates the economic situation per country and simulates the impact it has on nonplayer characters can achieve this with ease.
